add a way to remove physics bodies
Make render data buffer generated during runtime instead of just incremental (add and remove rendering stuff based on constraints)
add physics interpolation for frames (Physics is running at 50 fps (~20ms per frame) faster objects should appear to move smoother given a higher rendering fps)
